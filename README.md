## About Me Portfolio- Learn about Will Vining!

## This site shows a website that I built from scratch using HTML5 and CSS and showcases some of the things I have learned in the University of Arizona Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. 

The first picture will take you to a project I did for a fictional company called Horiseon Marketing Agency.

##Challenges

This was our second assignment during our second week of class after speeding through classes on HTML, CSS, GIT & Github. Despite going through everything at breakneck speed I did my best to follow the acceptence criteria and make a functional website.

There were many many roadblocks, which I would try to resolve by web resources, class materials, google, stack overflow W3 schools and youtube.

This assignment was fun but very difficult for me at first.

##Next Steps

I will continue to add to my portfolio as the class goes on and even after the bootcamp ends to showcase my skills.
