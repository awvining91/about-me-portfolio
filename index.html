        <P>My name is Will and I love tech and learning. I was born in 
            Albuquerque, New Mexico and went to college in Colorado. I love to 
            write and swing dance. I also like to make music and nature.

            I got into tech through a company called Skillcrush that taught me 
        the basics of web design and I was hooked! I think it's really fun building
        websites, tinkering around with new tech tools and learning new things.

        I hope to further my career in tech and continue to hone my skills in the 
        industry. 
        </P>
